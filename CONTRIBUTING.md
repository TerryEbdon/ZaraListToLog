# Contributing to ZaraListToLog

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and
transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Develop with GitHub

This project uses GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as
well as accept pull requests.

## Use GitHub Flow

We use [GitHub Flow]. All code changes happen through pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested:
   1. Add tests.
   2. Address issues identified by [CodeNarc]
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache-2.0 license

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be
under the same [Apache License version 2.0] that covers the project.

## Report bugs using [issues]

GitHub issues are used to track public bugs. Report a bug by
[opening a new issue]; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A short summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you
  tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- Two spaces for indentation
- English is the preferred language for all comments, issues, commits, pull
  requests and other communications.
- Prefer British or Irish spelling and grammar conventions in all comments, issues,
  commits, pull requests, and other communications. (This reduces Copilot
  comment spam.)
- American English may appear in code where required by APIs or libraries.
